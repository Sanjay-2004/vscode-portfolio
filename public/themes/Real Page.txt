Program-1

Concatenation is an operation that joins strings, 
For example, the concatenation of strings "smart" and "phone" is "smartphone"

Concatenation can be expanded to more than two strings, 
for example concatenating "co","dil" and "ity" results in "codility"

Given an array A consisting of strings, your function should
calculate the length of the longest string S such that 

S is a concatenation of some of the strings from A every letter in S is different 

Write a function:

class Solution { public int solution(String [] A) ; }


Given an Array A Consisiting of N Strings, 
Calculates the length of the longest string S fulfilling the conditions above. 
If no such string exists, your function should return 0.


Given A ={ "co","dil","ity"};

Your function should return 5. 
The resulting string S could be "codil","dilco","coity" or "ityco"

A = {"abc","yyy","def","csv"}
your function should print 6
"abcdef","defabc", "defcsv" or "csvdef"

A={"potato","kayak","banana","racecar"}
your function shuld print 0
It is impossible to choose any of these strings as each of them contains repeating letters.

A={eva,jqw,tyn,jan}
your function should return 9 

One of the possible strings of this length is "evajqwtyn"



Program-2

Write a function class Solution { public int solution(int [] A); }

that, given an array A consisting of N integers returns the biggest value X which occurs in A exactly 
X times. If there is no such value, the function should return 0

Given A={3,8,2,3,3,2}
the function should return 3;
The value 2 occurs exactly two times
and the value 3 occurs exactly three times
so they both meet the task conditions. THe value 8 occurs
just once, thus it does not meet the task conditions
THe maxmimum of 2 and 3 is 3

Given A = {7,1,2,8,2}

the function should return 2

The value 1 occurs exactly one time 
the value 2 occurs exactly two times

Given A ={3,1,4,1,5}
the function should return 0.
There is no value which meets the task conditions 

Given A ={5,5,5,5,5}
the function should return 5 

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions 

N is an integer in the range [1,100000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [1,1,000,000,000]



Program-3

There are N Empty glasses with a capacity of 1,2....N Litres(there is exactly one glass of each
unique capacity). 
You want to pour exactly K litres of water into glasses. 
Each glass may be either full or empty (a glass cannot be partially filled). 
What is the minimum number of glasses that you need to conatin K litres of water?

write a function 

class Solution{
public int solution(int N,int K)
{

}
}


that given two integers, N and K return the minimum number of glasses that are 
needed to contain exactly K litres of water. 
If it is not possible to pour exactly K litres of water into glasses then the 
function should return -1

Given N = 5, K=8, the function should return 2.
There are five glasses of capacity 1,2,3,4 and 5. 
You can use two glasses with capacity 3 and 5 to hold 8 litres of water.

Given N=4 and K=10, the function should return 4.
You must use all the glasses to contain 10 litres of water. 

Given N=1 and K=2, the function should return -1.
There is only one glass with capacity 1, so you cannot pour 2 litres of water.

Write an efficient alogirthm for the following assumptions 

N is an integer within the range [1...1,000,000];
K is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000];



Program-4

Write a function solution that, given an integer N returns the maximum possible value 
obtainable by deleting one '5' digit from the decimal representation of N.
It is guranteed that N will contain at least one '5' digit



Given N = 15958, the function should return 1958
N=-5859, the function should return -589
N=-5000, the function should return 0.
deleting the '5', the only digits in the number are zeroes
so its value is 0

Assume that
 N is an integer within the range 
 [-999,995..999,995]
 N contains at least one '5' digit in its decimal representation;
 N consists of atleast two digits in its decimal representation;

 In your solution, focus on correctness. 
 The performance of your solution will not be the focus of the assessment.
